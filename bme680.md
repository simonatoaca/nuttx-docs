## Writing the driver for the BME680 sensor

Before writing a driver it is important to familiarize yourself with the internals of the sensor by reading its [datasheet](https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/media/boschsensortec/downloads/datasheets/bst-bme680-ds001.pdf).

### What does the BME680 do?
- Performs **temperature, pressure, humidity and gas resistance** measurements.
- **Gas resistance** indicates the presence of [VOCs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatile_organic_compound) (such as CO2) in the air (A low gas resistance means the air is more polluted with VOCs).
- The data can be used for monitoring the quality of indoor air by calculating its **IAQ index**.
  
### Gas sensor working principle
- This is important to know because it affects the way we set up the sensor.
- BME680 uses a **MOX sensor** to detect VOCs in the air. This type of sensor contains a **metal-oxide surface** and a **heater**. As the surface is heated, it reacts with the surrounding gas and changes its conductivity, which is then measured as a resistance.
- The heater in the BME680 usually reaches between 200 to 400 degrees Celsius in a matter of about 100 milliseconds.

### Communicating with the sensor
- Reading and writing from/to the registers inside the sensor is done via **[I2C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C)** or **[SPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface)**. The logic for this interfacing is done in the ```bme680_getreg8``` and
```bme680_putreg8``` functions, which read/write from/to a register at a certain address in the memory of the sensor.
- On the Sparrow Board, the sensor is communicating over I2C, so the implementation of the driver does not have SPI support yet.
- The **register addresses** can be found in the datasheet and are declared as **macros** in the code, along with masks to isolate data (an 8-bit register can contain multiple types of data, as we will see soon).

### NuttX Sensor Interface
- The code that handles every sensor in NuttX can be found in ```sensor.c``` and ```sensor.h```, where the interfacing of the sensor with the "outside world" is done via calls like open, close, read, write or ioctl (among others). Ultimately, the sensor will be seen as a **file** from the user's perspective.
- When writing the driver, we do not directly write the ```open``` method, but provide an internal method (in our case it is called ```bme680_activate```).
- When we will write ```open``` in our app, it will refer to the sensor general-purpose method found in ```sensor.c```, which will then call ```activate``` from the sensor's lowerhalf, defined in ```bme680.c```.
- Mapping our functions to their roles is done like this (explanations can be found in ```sensor.h```):

    ```c
    static const struct sensor_ops_s g_sensor_ops =
    {
        NULL,                 /* open */
        NULL,                 /* close */
        bme680_activate,      /* activate */
        NULL,                 /* set_interval */
        NULL,                 /* batch */
        bme680_fetch,         /* fetch */
        NULL,                 /* selftest */
        NULL,                 /* set_calibvalue */
        bme680_calibrate,     /* calibrate */
        NULL                  /* control */
    };
    ```
- Since the sensor will be seen as a **file**, the interface defines its own **file-specific methods**:
    ```c
    static const struct file_operations g_sensor_fops =
    {
        sensor_open,    /* open  */
        sensor_close,   /* close */
        sensor_read,    /* read  */
        sensor_write,   /* write */
        NULL,           /* seek  */
        sensor_ioctl,   /* ioctl */
        NULL,           /* mmap */
        NULL,           /* truncate */
        sensor_poll     /* poll  */
    };
    ```
